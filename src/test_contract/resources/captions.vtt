00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.290
Germs, this is Tintern Abbey, it's one
of a number of monasteries dissolved

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.070
during the reign of Henry VIII
between 1536 and 1541.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.750
Before that the English and Welsh
landscape was rich with these spaces.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.410
They were, with all their songs,
prayers and

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.220
books, an integral part of
the landscape and culture.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.270
It been said that no where in England
could you be more than a 30 minute

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.480
walk from the monastery like this.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.450
Since they occupied so much land, about a
third of the land in England to be clear,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.030
and on that scale they provided
a lot of employment and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.300
they also provided a lot of education.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.550
Now remember,
this is before universal public education.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.640
In fact, one could easily argue that
the destruction of these monasteries

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.580
set back the education of women in
England by a couple hundred years,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.350
source in the description below.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.280
The impact of these structures, though,
went far beyond practical purposes,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.200
like employment and education.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.480
Their primary function was prayer, and

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.790
through this prayer they served as
a contact point between heaven and Earth.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.670
They connected the fabric of England
to the divine, and in the 15th century,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.880
that is a practical purpose, so
I'm sorry if I implied that it wasn't.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.560
The monasteries also kept the books and
the relics.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.060
Unless you were one of the elites and
able to attend university,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.250
these institutions were your best hope of
learning how to read, or to find a book.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.400
The relics that they held attracted
tourists from all over and

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.470
stimulated local economies.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.090
Back then tourists were called pilgrims,
so basically they were responsible for

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.390
education, employment, and tourism, and
the very salvation of one's community.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.890
They were pretty important places,
but they had their problems too.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.140
All that land these monasteries occupied,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.270
technically belonged to the church,
which was headquartered in Rome, so

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.888
the revenue that they generated
had to be filtered through Rome.

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:55.760
Henry the VIII's decision for
England to leave the Catholic church

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.370
in 1534 wasn't just symbolic,
it was also a land grab.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.110
He felt that the state of England,
him, could manage that land better.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.110
There were other problems, too, those
libraries really only had religious books.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.890
The education that they provided was
really only religious education.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.600
The employment structures that they used
were often corrupt, inefficient, or both.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.740
And finally those relics that
had attracted those tourists,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.330
they were often fabricated.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.870
They weren't real, monasteries
claimed to have stuff like milk from

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.830
the Virgin Mary's breast, which is
both a strange claim and a false one.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.100
So when Henry VIII's agents
dissolved these monasteries and

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.240
they took off the roofs,
they confiscated and

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.960
destroyed the relics along with
a whole bunch of religious art.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.290
The destruction of religious structures
like this has a special name in our

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.600
history, Iconoclasm.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.820
And that's what I want to
talk about in this video,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.150
the relationship between art and faith.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.030
The Protestant Reformation which took
place in Europe during the reign

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.900
of Henry the VIII provoked waves of
Iconoclasm, statues were broken and

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.090
the walls were white washed.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.540
The belief system behind this, the belief
that religious art has a pernicious affect

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.370
on the viewer was not new or
exclusive to Protestants.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.620
Other Abrahamic religions Judaism and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.590
Islam both do not permit
representational art.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.700
Both will cite the story of Moses and

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.610
the golden calf as proof of
art's negative impact on faith.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.720
When Moses came down from Mount Sinai
with the Ten Commandments, he found his

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.380
brother Aaron and the Israelites
worshiping a golden calf instead of God.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.200
Which was unfortunate because one of those
commandments said that there shouldn't be

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.180
any graven images worshiped
above the divinity.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.450
So they got in trouble with God,
that's bad.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.430
But Christianity has always
been different in that regard.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.360
There is a rich tradition of
representational Christian art.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.380
One of the defining authors of
the Christian doctrine, Luke,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.300
the author of the Gospel of Luke,
is rumored to have also been a painter.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.790
And one of his subjects was none
other than the Virgin Mary.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.655
So if Luke can do it,
why can't I, why can't Raphael?

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.420
Additionally, there's the story
of Christ carrying his cross and

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.020
being given a cloth to wipe his face with.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.920
When the cloth was returned
to the woman who provided it,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.700
she found Christ's face
had been imprinted there.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.960
We don't know the name of this woman
who gave the cloth to Jesus, so

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.540
Christians have ever since referred to
her as the Saint of the True Image, or

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.570
in Latin, vero-icona, Veronica,
she's Saint Veronica.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.730
The point is she had a picture of Jesus,
and

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.270
that's cool, so
representational art is cool.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.240
The general philosophy in Catholicism is
that representational art of Jesus or

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.480
Mary is fine.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.720
Not only because of Luke and Veronica but

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.568
because people can tell the difference
between representation and reality.

00:04:39.568 --> 00:04:44.230
No one will try to cut down a picture of
a tree thinking it would provide firewood,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.570
so nobody would pray to
a painting of Jesus and

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.610
mistake the painting for being Jesus,
we're smarter than that.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.106
But that's not really true, we may like to
think people know the difference between

00:04:55.106 --> 00:04:57.705
representation and
the thing represented, but

00:04:57.705 --> 00:05:00.830
there notable examples of when
this failed to be the case.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.690
Take, for example, the story of
a painting printed in a work from 1476.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.266
In the story, Pope Boniface VIII
oversees the reconstruction and

00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:13.950
redecoration of the old Basilica
of Saint John Lateran, in Rome.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.810
His artists follow their instructions, and
then take initiative to fill in some blank

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.780
spaces with a portrait of Saint Francis
and a portrait of Saint Anthony.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.231
Boniface accepts the portrait
of Saint Francis but

00:05:24.231 --> 00:05:26.060
orders Saint Anthony be removed.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.050
But then the story goes that the workers
sent to remove it were driven

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.240
away by a terrible gigantic spirit and
couldn't perform the task.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.141
Boniface conceded,
let Saint Anthony alone,

00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:40.380
he said,
since we can see he wants to stay.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.190
Clearly this painting was treated
as though it was Saint Anthony and

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.250
not a simple representation
of Saint Anthony.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.880
And this wasn't some uneducated guy
living on the edge of civilization,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.930
this was the Pope.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.460
So protestants like John Calvin who
preached iconoclasm have their reasons.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.830
The representation of God or Mary or
the communion of saints could be worshiped

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.010
instead of the concept of the divine
that they were intended to represent.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.000
Especially in the years before
the Protestant Reformation.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.500
I mean, I've been guilty
of worshiping Michelangelo.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.530
But this worship of the representation in
place of the divine is the golden calf

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.260
story all over again.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.045
So there were two factions, the Catholics
who continued to believe in the positive

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:23.250
elements of representational art
outweighed the negatives, and

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.370
the Protestants who saw representational
art as extremely dangerous.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.420
Art communicates through the senses and
so ultimately this is a question of

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.690
whether or not our senses can be leveraged
to build religious knowledge and faith.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.980
Or if they're just a distraction from true
faith which doesn't require the senses.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.920
Different religions deal with
this question differently.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.790
If we leave the Abrahamic religions for

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.520
a second, we can look at
Tibetan Buddhism for further insight.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.310
In that tradition, the practitioners
believe that the full scope of the human

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.030
experience, including sense perception
can be leveraged to enlightenment.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.770
Think of it like this, have you ever
felt spiritually connected to a song?

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.510
Have you entered a space and been stopped
suddenly by the power of the architecture?

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.650
Seen a sunset that forced
you to be silent for

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.795
a second, danced so wildly that you
seemed to lose yourself in a moment.

00:07:11.795 --> 00:07:16.095
Well, some religious traditions think
those kinds of spiritual moments can be

00:07:16.095 --> 00:07:18.895
a path to understanding
something greater than yourself.

00:07:18.895 --> 00:07:22.275
In fact, Catholicism doubled down on
that approach in the years following

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.155
the Reformation with Baroque art,

00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:27.900
which clearly emphasizes
the role of sensory perception.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.100
Spaces like these are intended
to leverage your senses and

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.280
to inspire a religious experience.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.569
So let's return to the ruins
of Tintern Abbey, they remain,

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:40.380
albeit in ruins, and
remind us of a time when these once

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.120
great structures represented
a connection between heaven and Earth.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.120
The physical presence of this structure,

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.110
the chanting, the singing, they all lifted
this space up to commune with the divine.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.420
The sensory experience of these activities
has connected England to heaven, and

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.190
now the stones slowly return to nature.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.040
So we have to return to that question,
what is the relationship of art to faith?

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.840
Can physical senses be
manipulated through art

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.910
to inspire faith in something greater than
ourselves, or are they a distraction?

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.500
There are a lot of similarities between
the art world and the religious world.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.810
Indeed, it's difficult to name an artistic
medium that doesn't have its origins

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.460
in religious ritual.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.930
And when you enter a museum or

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.080
religious structure, there is
a similar reverence for the space.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.810
A certain quiet but
also a certain expectation of meaning.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.640
We have a built-in assumption in these
spaces that the objects we see have

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.440
an intention or
meaning beyond their physical reality.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.720
Like take those relics I discussed
earlier, for example, real or

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.310
not, they had power, they could elevate
the perceptor's religious imagination.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.590
We all have objects that have
an unreasonable significance or

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.770
a sentimental value to
us on a personal level.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.320
Those relics had that, but at a communal
or shared level, and that's real.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.240
That feeling isn't fake even if
the stories surrounding the object is.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.120
Art consistently does that as well,
it can lift an every day object up and

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.990
inject it with significance.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.460
Think of Duchamp's readymades or Louise
Nevelson's sculptures from salvaged wood.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.610
The ruins of Tintern Abbey no longer
sit in the tradition of Christianity.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.920
No one sees Tintern Abbey as
a link to the heavens anymore.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.980
But we are certainly awed by it and
walking in these ruins does connect us to

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.600
something, our past maybe, our
instinctual love of the aesthetic form,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.252
our relationship to time,
our relationship to nature.

00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:30.950
And I have no idea,

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:35.060
I know this space has significance
greater than the stones that compose it.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.915
I know that I'm having
a spiritual moment here and

00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:41.265
it's not just me,
these ruins have inspired poetry.

00:09:41.265 --> 00:09:44.945
If you've ever heard of Tintern Abby
before this video, it's most likely

00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:48.575
because you've read the poem by
William Wordsworth in your English class.

00:09:48.575 --> 00:09:51.405
They also inspired artists,
like JMW Turner or

00:09:51.405 --> 00:09:53.995
Elizabeth Hay, and
numerous others as well.

00:09:53.995 --> 00:09:58.430
These monasteries once held religious art,
objects with a theatrical purpose,

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:03.090
objects beyond objecthood that
spectators projected meaning onto.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:07.580
Churches, monasteries, and other religious
buildings around the world still do that,

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.840
but today we also have art museums
that fulfill a similar role.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.370
So I'm still left wondering what that
relationship between art and faith is.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.160
Is it an aid or a distraction?

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.530
Are art galleries religious spaces,
have they replaced religious spaces?

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.220
I don't know, but i'd love to hear
your thoughts in the comments below.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.220
